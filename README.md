## Modules

Kairo is split up into several separate modules.
You will need a number of these.
Each module falls into one of 3 categories:

1. **Common modules:**
   These are intended for your use.
   You will use some or all of these.
   API stability is guaranteed.
2. **Optional modules:**
   You may use these modules, but they won't always be necessary.
   API stability is guaranteed.
3. **Internal modules:**
   These are only intended for internal use.
   Use them at your own risk; API stability is not guaranteed.

### Common modules

**Core modules:**

- [kairo-server](./kairo-server):
  A Server is an application that runs a set of Features.
- [kairo-feature](./kairo-feature):
  Features are Kairo's main building block.
- [kairo-logging](./kairo-logging):
  Logging uses the [kotlin-logging](https://github.com/oshai/kotlin-logging) interface,
  which should be configured to use Apache Log4j2 under the hood.
- [kairo-config](./kairo-config):
  Home of `ConfigLoader`, which loads configs for Kairo Servers from YAML files.
  Includes support for config extension and application,
  as well as various sources.
- [kairo-serialization](./kairo-serialization):
  Uses [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson).
  to handle JSON, YAML, and even XML serialization.
- [kairo-testing](./kairo-testing):
  A convenient testing library which includes some helpful test dependencies.

  Some useful utilities.

**Feature modules:**

  Kairo's Google Cloud Scheduler Feature enables CRON
  using Google Cloud Scheduler.

- [kairo-health-check-feature](./kairo-health-check-feature):
  Kairo's Health Check Feature configures liveness and readiness health check REST endpoints.
- [kairo-id-feature](./kairo-id-feature):
  Kairo IDs are an optional way to uniquely identify entities.
  Think of them as an alternative to `UUID`s or serial IDs, but with a few perks.
  Includes testable ID generation code.
- [kairo-logging-feature](./kairo-logging-feature):
  This Feature supports logging within Kairo Servers.
- [kairo-rest-feature](./kairo-rest-feature):
  The REST Feature adds support for REST endpoints, including auth.
  Under the hood, this Feature uses [Ktor](https://ktor.io/).
- [kairo-slack-feature](./kairo-slack-feature):
  Kairo's Slack Feature provides a basic interface to send Slack messages.
- [kairo-sql-feature](./kairo-sql-feature):
  The SQL Feature adds support for SQL databases.
  Under the hood, this Feature uses [JDBI](https://jdbi.org/).
- [kairo-sql-migration-feature](./kairo-sql-migration-feature):
  The SQL Migration Feature complements [kairo-sql-feature](./kairo-sql-feature).
  by adding support for database migrations.
  Under the hood, this Feature uses [Flyway Community](https://www.red-gate.com/products/flyway/community/).
- [kairo-uuid-feature](./kairo-uuid-feature):

- [kairo-date-range](./kairo-date-range):
  Library for date range types.
- [kairo-dependency-injection](./kairo-dependency-injection):
  Makes Guice available,
  along with some utilities to make its use more idiomatic.

  which is the JVM's way of adding context to log lines.

### Internal modules

- [kairo-command-runner](./kairo-command-runner):
  `CommandRunner` runs shell commands.
  It delegates to Java's built-in way of doing this,
  but uses an abstract class for testability.
- [kairo-environment-variable-supplier](./kairo-environment-variable-supplier):
  `EnvironmentVariableSupplier` supplies environment variables.
  It delegates to Java's built-in way of doing this,
  but uses an abstract class for testability.
- [kairo-gcp-secret-supplier](./kairo-gcp-secret-supplier):
  `GcpSecretSupplier` supplies GCP secrets.
  It delegates to the GCP Secret Manager SDK,
  but uses an abstract class for testability.
- [kairo-google-common](./kairo-google-common):

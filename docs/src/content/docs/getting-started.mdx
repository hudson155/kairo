_This section assumes you're using Gradle._

Kairo is hosted on Google Artifact Registry,
so you'll first need to add the Google Artifact Registry plugin
and connect to Airborne Software repository.

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts

plugins {
  id("com.google.cloud.artifactregistry.gradle-plugin")
}

repositories {
  maven {
    url = uri("artifactregistry://us-central1-maven.pkg.dev/highbeam-kairo/maven")
  }
}
```

## Using one (or just a few) Kairo libraries

Kairo's [standalone libraries](/modules/kairo-config/)
can be used independently within your existing project.

To use a single Kairo library,
you could just add it to your `dependencies` block as you normally would.

<Code code={`// build.gradle.kts

dependencies {
  implementation("com.highbeam.kairo:YOUR-LIBRARY-OF-CHOICE:${versionData.latest}")
}`} lang="kotlin" />

However, we recommend using Kairo's BOM
to keep your Kairo dependencies aligned.

<Code code={`// build.gradle.kts

dependencies {
  implementation(platform("com.highbeam.kairo:bom:${versionData.latest}"))
  implementation("com.highbeam.kairo:YOUR-LIBRARY-OF-CHOICE")
}`} lang="kotlin" />

## Building a Kairo application

Great choice! You're in for a treat.

If you're building your entire application with Kairo,
we highly recommend using Kairo's _full_ BOM,
which not only keeps your Kairo dependencies aligned
but also aligns several external library versions.

<Code code={`// build.gradle.kts

dependencies {
  implementation(platform("com.highbeam.kairo:bom-full:${versionData.latest}"))
}`} lang="kotlin" />

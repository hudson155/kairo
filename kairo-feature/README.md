# `kairo-feature`

Features are the primary building block of Kairo applications.
Every piece of functionality,
from framework-level REST or SQL behaviour
to application-specific implementations
to third-party integrations
is represented by a Kairo Feature.

Note: Treat Kairo _Features_ as proper nouns (the first letter should be capitalized).

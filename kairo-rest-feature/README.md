# `kairo-rest-feature`

The REST Feature adds support for REST endpoints.
Under the hood, this Feature uses [Ktor](https://ktor.io/).
Even if you're not building a REST API, you might need to include this to support health checks.

This feature is currently under active development. Documentation will be complete shortly.
